                    <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> An elegant, malty German amber lager with a clean, rich,
                        toasty and bready malt flavor, restrained bitterness, and a dry finish that encourages another
                        drink. The overall malt impression is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich aftertaste that is
                        never cloying or heavy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> An elegant, malty German amber lager with a balanced,
                        complementary beechwood smoke character. Toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained
                        bitterness, low to high smoke flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish are
                        characteristic.</p>
                    <p><strong>History:</strong> A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region
                        of Bavaria in Germany. Beechwood-smoked malt is used to make a Märzen-style amber lager. The
                        smoke character of the malt varies by maltster; some breweries produce their own smoked malt
                        (rauchmalz).</p>

                    <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> A dark, strong, malty German lager beer that emphasizes the
                        malty-rich and somewhat toasty qualities of continental malts without being sweet in the finish.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>History:</strong> Originated in the Northern German city of Einbeck, which was a brewing
                        center and popular exporter in the days of the Hanseatic League (14th to 17th century).
                        Recreated in Munich starting in the 17th century. The name “bock” is based on a corruption of
                        the name “Einbeck” in the Bavarian dialect, and was thus only used after the beer came to
                        Munich. “Bock” also means “Ram” in German, and is often used in logos and advertisements.</p>
